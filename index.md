# Welcome to Kamalika's webpage
I am a technology development and data analysis engineer at Intel Corporation. I was a postdoctoral fellow in Mechanical Engineering department of Cornell University. I received my PhD and MS from Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering (MechSE) in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My career interests are in data science, machine learning, numerical modeling, finite element simulations, materials science, x-ray diffraction. I have enjoyed public speaking through several conferences and community events.
