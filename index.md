# Welcome to Kamalika's webpage
I am a technology development engineer at Intel Corporation. I was a postdoctoral fellow in Mechanical Engineering department of Cornell University. I received my PhD and MS from Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering (MechSE) in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are in materials science, deformation of aerospace and geological materials, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, crystal-plasticity based finite element simulations. Apart from several conferences, I have enjoyed public speaking through SCIENCE ON TAP and  three minute presentations. My research collaborations have been with scientists from Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory,  Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, Purdue University and University of California Santa Barbara .
